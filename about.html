            <p>
                Hashing is also involved in URLs. Tree based URL search engines are wrote using hashing code.
                The tree URL search engine is based on many multidimensional hashing tables. A
                multidimensional
                hashing table is a hash table that makes sure that there are no hash clashes for each portion of
                the
                URL. The entire URL is put through the tree based search engine until the URL is matched with the key
                hashing nodes. This idea is extremely important because the internet works on URLs and URL need to
                match to websites.</p>

            <h1 id="first">Hashing Functions</h1>
            <p>
                One of the various forms of hashing is hash functions. Just like the many ideas & different ways to
                write
                code, there are many different ways to write a hash function.
                “The compression function is usually
                designed
                from scratch or made out of a block-cipher.” A compression function, or more
                specifically, a one-way compression function, transforms two fixed size inputs into one fixed size
                output &
                makes it hard to differentiate between the two. A block-cipher is an encryption method that
                encrypts a block of code instead of encrypting a small piece at a time. A hash function itself has a
                much lower risk than
                encryption.
            </p>

            <h1>Hashing Tables</h1>
            <p>
                Another method of hashing is to use hash tables. A hash table is a data structure that maps keys to
                its values. A hash table
                computes an index into an array of buckets or slots. A table works by a hash being applied to create a
                first index on the table. A dual hashing table is made up of hash functions
                and
                the second hash table comes from the first table.
                You can create a large table by using a hash function for each of the indexes. The second hash table is
                based off of the first table's hash function and the indexes. Also, the second table is based off of
                the
                second index on the first hashing table. Each hashing table references the previous. </p>

            <h1>Rainbow Tables</h1>
            <p>
                Another type
                of hashing is a rainbow table. A rainbow table is used to reverse a hash table. Hackers can use this
                forms of hashing to find users information and their passwords. A rainbow
                table will crack a users password faster than other methods. However, a rainbow table takes up a lot of
                space
                on a computer. </p>
