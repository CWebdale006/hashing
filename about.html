            <h1 id="first">Hashing Tables</h1>
            <p>Another kind of hashing are hash tables. A hash table is a data structure that maps keys to its values. It
            computes an index in to an array of buckets or slots. A dual hashing table is made up of hash functions and
            the second hash table comes from the first table. So a table works by a hashing is applied to create a
            first index on the table.
            So you can create a large table by using a hash function for each of the indexes. The second hash table is
            based off of the first tables hash function and the indexes. Also the second table is based off of the
            second index on the first hashing table. This what a hashing table is based off of.
            Hackers use various forms of hashing to find Users information and the passwords. One of the various forms
            of Hashing is a rainbow table. A rainbow table is a form of hashing to reverse a hash table. A rainbow
            table will crack a users password in a shorter amount of time. But a rainbow table takes up a lot of space
            on a computer. A rainbow table is a much faster and efficient way than the Brute-force approach.</p>
          
            <h1>Hashing Functions</h1>
            <p>One of these methods of hashing is a hash function. Just like the many ideas & different ways to write
            hash, there are many different ways to write a hash function. “The compression function is usually designed
            from scratch or made out of a block-cipher.” First off, a block-cipher is an encryption method that
            encrypts a block of code instead of encrypting a small piece at a time. A compression function, or more
            specifically a one-way compression function, transforms two fixed size inputs into one fixed size output &
            makes it hard to differentiate between the two. A hash function itself has a much lower risk than
            encryption.
            Idk what’s going on</p>

            <h1>Hashing/cryptocurrency</h1>
            <p>Hash code is a huge deal with cryptocurrency like bitcoin. To get bitcoin, people have to use hash code to
            find the bitcoin. These people that do try to gain access to bitcoin are called miners. But mining for
            bitcoin is not easy. To get Bitcoin, there are hash algorithms and codes that must be applied right to find
            the coin. There is a hash rate and a difficulty level. Hash rate is the rate of which the hash algorithms
            and the hash code works and searches. So the value of bitcoin is so high because so few people can do such
            a thing and mine for Bitcoin. But Bitcoin is not the only cryptocurrency that uses hash.</p>
          
            <h1>Hashing URl</h1>
            <p>
            Hashing is also involved in URLs. This is a tree based URl search engine that is wrote using hashing code.
            The tree URL search engine is based on many multidimensional hashing tables. A node has multidimensional
            hashing table is a hash table that makes sure that there are no hash crashes and for each portion of the
            URl. The entire URl is put through the tree based Search engine until the URL is matched with the key
            hashing nodes. This Idea is so important because the internet works on URls and URl match to websites.</p>
