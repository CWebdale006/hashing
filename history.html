        <p id="history">The one to introduce the random oracle model, a simple, highly efficient & practical problem solver, was
            Bellare & Rogaway. At first glance, some would assume that the hash function is replaced by some random
            function. The ROM, or random oracle model, has proven the security if multiple cryptosystems & has spurred
            the appearance of other simple yet effective designs that are widely used. A similar model is the ideal
            cipher model, or the ICM. Instead of using a random function, the ICM uses block ciphers.
            A cryptographic hash function is a hash function and the main idea of this function is to protect the
            information of other people. The hash functions were first started in cryptology in the early 80â€™s. These
            were sooner found out that they able to solve other security issues. Also could secure other information.
            These functions also secure networks.</p>
 
        <p id="history">Hashing was Introduced by Salakhutdinov and Hinton, semantic hashing uses binary code to agree with the
            semantic similarity via the hamming distance between codewords. To elaborate, everything in the database
            would be regarded as binary code. Semantic hashing uses compact binary code. It is set up this way so that
            identical items would have identical codewords. The retrieval for semantic hashing is extraordinarily
            quick, approximately millions of queries every second. However, the key to make all of this work is to
            provide good code. Said good code has to meet the criteria, (a) can be easily calculated so that it could
            be used for the novel input (b) calls for a minimal number of bits for the dataset code & (c) direct
            equivalent items to their matching counterparts.</p>
