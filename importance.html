        <p>Hash code is a huge deal with cryptocurrency like bitcoin. To get bitcoin, people have to use hash code to
            find the bitcoin. These people that do try to gain access to bitcoin are called miners. But mining for
            bitcoin is not easy. To get Bitcoin, there are hash algorithms and codes that must be applied right to find
            the coin. There is a hash rate and a difficulty level. Hash rate is the rate of which the hash algorithms
            and the hash code works and searches. So the value of bitcoin is so high because so few people can do such
            a thing and mine for Bitcoin. But Bitcoin is not the only cryptocurrency that uses hash.</p>

        <p>There is a new type of hashing and the type of hashing is called Virtual Hashing. Virtual Hashing modifies
            the Hashing function. Virtual Hashing comes into play when collisions happen and then Virtual hashing will
            make changes to the Hash Function. If there is a file that has several accesses to it, virtual hashing will
            cover all the accesses. Virtual Hashing basically provides solutions for Original Hashing functions
            collisions. This is important because Hashing is evolving and it shows that web security is being taken
            serious and it is becoming more difficult to get people's information.</p>

        <p>The importance of hashing is crucial. The case “Linkedin User privacy” in the District of California was
            based on hackers getting passwords and the user account. Linkedin failed to protect the users and their
            information from hackers. They were only using a hash function. They added a new encryption method that
            used both salted and hash passwords to keep the users information safe. Plaintiff stated that Linkedin had
            a false accusation that they keep all passwords and information secured. Linkedin was only using a hash
            function while standards states that user information and the passwords to be kept in a hashed and salted
            function. Using only hash functions are weaker than salted and Hashed functions. Slated has been in
            practice since the 70’s and its best protection to use both salted and hashed functioning. So hash is so
            important because if there was no hash, Linkedin would have not been able to protect the users information.</p>

                Hashing tables can be used for a lot of things. A hash table can be used to look up an IP address.
                Depending on the length of the IP address there are going to be main tables and dual or sub tables. To
                lookup or to locate a IP address, there are several steps that have to be done correct to lookup the
                correct and accurate IP address.
