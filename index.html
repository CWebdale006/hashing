            <h1>Clashes</h1>
            <p>
                A clash is two different inputs producing the same output in a hash address. Clashes can not be found
                or determined unless the quantities are in a table. Keys are used to find values in a table.
                This is why quantities that can find a clash are called keys.

            <p>
                There are many essentials of computing. One essential of computing is coding the components that help
                the computer operate better and also improve the properties for online processes. Hashing helps to make
                those improvements. Hashing is the idea to seperate and specify a particle subject out of a group.
                There are many ways to do this, and many different kinds of hashing. There are hashing tables, URLS,
                functions, as well as being applicable in cryptocurrency.
